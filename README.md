# Setup

### Install Prerequisites

You will need to install NodeJS, Redis, and an IDE of your preference (I recommend VSCode). You can find the necessary resources here:

NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Redis Server:

- Windows: https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis
- Mac: `brew install redis`
- Linux: `apt-get install redis`

VSCode (strongly recommended, but not required): https://code.visualstudio.com/
ESLint Extension for VSCode: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint

VSCode (with the ESLint extension) is the recommended environment. When using this setup, make sure that your selected workspace is the root folder that you have cloned, this will ensure that the ESLint plugin can work with our linting rules. Using this plugin will make adhering to the linting rules significantly easier.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are populated from the `.env` file. There is no `.env` file checked in, so the first thing you need to do is copy `.env_EXAMPLE` to `.env` and fill out the values. Cube Cobra uses several AWS resources, including S3, DynamoDB, and Cloudwatch. For development purposes, you will need to create an AWS account and insert your credentials into the `.env` file.

Here is a table on how to fill out the env vars:

### Initial Setup

For the first setup, you will need to run:

```sh
yarn install && yarn build
node one_shot_scripts/create_local_files.js
node --max-old-space-size=4096 one_shot_scripts/createTables.js
node --max-old-space-size=4096 jobs/update_cards.js
```

If you are on Windows, you will need to set bash as your script shell:
You will need to make sure you have `bash` installed somewhere and run the following command [with your `bash` path in place of the path below].

    yarn config set script-shell "C:\\Program Files\\git\\bin\\bash.exe"

Then you can start the program like so:

    yarn devstart

You can now open up a browser and connect to the app through: http://localhost:8080. Despite the fact that node says it is running on port 5000, you should use port 8080 to connect.

Nodemon will restart the application anytime there is a change to a source file.

### Updating Card Definitions and Analytics

From the previous script, `jobs/update_cards` is what creates the card definitions. Running this script will pull the latest data from scryfall. If you want card analytics, you'll need to run the following scripts in this order:

```sh
node --max-old-space-size=4096 jobs/update_draft_history.js
node --max-old-space-size=4096 jobs/update_cube_history.js
node --max-old-space-size=4096 jobs/update_metadata_dict.js
node --max-old-space-size=4096 jobs/update_cards.js
```

# Concepts

### Cards

We keep all card definitions in large pre-processed files, so that nodes in production just need to download and load the files, and can fetch the latest files from S3 when they're ready. We do this because it's much faster to read from memory than to have to make requests to some other service anytime we need card data. An external process is responsible for updating the card definitions, and uploading to S3. This same process is also responsible for updating the card analytics, and data exports.

### Multiplayer Drafting

We use redis for concurrency control for multiplayer drafting. All redis operations are handled in `multiplayerDrafting.js`
